# Yaka-Arrow-Project-OpenGL

Hi! This is my first ever graphics project, using Python and OpenGL.

The project was inspired by the "Yaka Arrow", which is Yondu's whistle-controlled arrow in Guardians of the Galaxy.

**The project:**
- is a game and graphics engine, created from scratch!
- visualises an arrow which can be moved in 3D space
- has a free-moving camera to show complex lighting effects
- uses algorithm calculated surface normals to model realistic lighting
- is in its first iteration, with plenty of functionality yet to come

**How to demo:**
1. Download everything in this repository. That is, github.com/MaxwellSchroder/Yaka-Arrow-Project-OpenGL
2. Open start.py in an IDE
3. Install all required python packages, listed at the start of the file. (Also listed in this readme.md)
4. Run start.py

**Controls:**

  Arrow Controls:
- Up Arrow key to move forward
- Left and Right Arrow keys to change orientation of arrow left and right

  Camera Controls:
- WASD keys to control all lateral movement
- Left Shift key and Space Bar key to change the height of the camera downwards and upwards, respectively

**Required Python Depencies:**
pip install PyOpenGl numpy pyrr pygame pillow scikit-learn glfw
